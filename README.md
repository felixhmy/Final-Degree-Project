# Final-Degree-Project

As part of my undergraduate thesis, I conducted research comparing various game development engines for web game development.

The comparison is divided into the engines: Unity, Godot, Construct 3, Phaser Editor, and Defold.

This project focuses only on the development and structure of the project; the rest of the artistic elements have been obtained through free use licenses.
